## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and concise
- Add docstrings to classes and functions

Example:
```python
def add_mapping(self, key_combo: str, app_path: str) -> bool:
    """
    Add a new key to application mapping
    
    Args:
        key_combo: The keyboard combination (e.g., 'ctrl+shift+a')
        app_path: Full path to the application executable
        
    Returns:
        True if mapping was added successfully, False otherwise
    """
    # Implementation...
```

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests still pass
- Test on Windows (multiple versions if possible)
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Documentation

- Update README.md if adding user-facing features
- Update CHANGE_LOG.md with your changes
- Add inline comments for complex code
- Update docstrings as needed

### Commit Messages

Write clear commit messages:
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Keep first line under 50 characters
- Provide detailed description if needed

Good examples:
```
Add mouse button mapping support

Implement hotkey recording feature
- Add recording button to GUI
- Capture key presses during recording
- Update configuration system
```
